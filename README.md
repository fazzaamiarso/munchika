## Name Origin

This app name was made in rush for the hackathon, So I just came up with "Power of Music" translated to Japanese "Ongaku no Chikara", but abbreviated to ONNCHI.
I keep thinking about the name and I don't really like it. So, I just change to "Music no Chikara" which basically is the same thing, but better if abbreviated "Munchika".

## Tech Used
### Full-stack
- Remix.run + Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase

### Tooling
- ESLint + Prettier
- Husky + Lint-staged

### Testing
- Cypress (E2E/integration)
- Vitess (Unit)
- Testing Library

## Improvements & Wishlist
- [ ] use prisma.io with supabase(or move to planetescale??) because prisma has better types that comes with schema.
- [ ] integrates CI for testing.
- [ ] mock API calls with MSW for seamless testing.
- [ ] handle complex app logic with xstate?
