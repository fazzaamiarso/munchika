## Name Origin

This app name was made in rush for the hackathon, So I just came up with "Power of Music" translated to Japanese "Ongaku no Chikara", but abbreviated to ONNCHI.
I keep thinking about the name and I don't really like it. So, I just change to "Music no Chikara" which basically is the same thing, but better if abbreviated "Munchika".
